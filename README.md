# Sequence.ME
SEQUENCE.ME~
A Sequencing External MAX/MSP Object by Joshuasca. sequence.me~ is a transport linked phasor-based sequence object. sequence.me generates a primary whole note phasor and a division phasor based on transport time-signature. the div-phasor also has both a trigger and a stepped output. in addition to this, there are two probability gates, one for step probability and another for ratchet probability, both of which also have stepped signal outputs. finally, sequence.me~ also produces a randomized stepped signal output with an envelope
